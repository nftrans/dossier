NFTrans
OUR STRENGTH TRANSFORMS

Summary:

It is well known that the trans population in Brazil suffers from numerous violences that range from access to education, 
work, and housing to extreme violence - Brazil is the country that kills the most trans people in the world (source: ANTRA). 
Historically excluded from society, we are people with a low life expectancy - the average is 35 years.

Simultaneously, the contemporary world is undergoing a profound transformation with the development of Web 3.0 - a space 
that is presumed to be decentralized, where people have more control over their data, a network built and operated by 
its users. In this environment, there is much talk about community, decentralization, and cooperation. However, who are 
the people who can navigate these waves? As a trans woman, artist, and active in Web 3, I observe that the exclusion is 
mirrored. How is it possible to construct a new paradigm if we continue to reproduce oppressions and violence?

Considering that living in diversity is fundamental for creating healthy environments, my project aims to connect the 
trans community with Web 3 through art, technology, education, and decentralized finances.

NFTrans is configured as a collaborative and transparent system for resource distribution that aims to financially support 
this community, in addition to establishing a support network for builders and trans artists in Web3. This is historical 
reparation with the generation of economic and social independence.

NFTrans - Our Strength Transforms.

Context:

About 2% of the Brazilian adult population is made up of transgender and non-binary people. Recent research reveals that 
the majority of these people did not complete high school and do not have a fixed job, surviving on freelance or short-term 
jobs, most often without a contract due to the prejudice suffered. The majority are made up of transvestites and trans women, 
with whom the percentages of exclusion increase exponentially.

Until the year 2018, there were not even data about this portion of the population because gender questioning was not 
included in the IBGE surveys. Through the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals (ANTRA), data about these 
people became public and visible, revealing an even harder reality: Brazil is the country that kills the most trans people 
in the world, and these crimes, for the most part, remain unpunished - and here also among transvestites and trans women is 
the highest percentage of murders according to data from the 2019 dossier produced by the Association.

Living in conditions of vulnerability, transgender and non-binary people remain excluded from the means of production, 
consumption, and symbolic capital. However, increasingly organized in associations, they have been showing their strength, 
creativity, and power. There are many issues to fight for, and many paths have already been traced. Recently, the trans 
cause has been taking a leading role in important media spaces through the voice of various artists who make up the current musical scene.

Art is a powerful means of sensitization and communication among people. I observe that beyond the leading artists, 
there is an immense and very rich diversity of trans artists in the daily guerrilla, carrying their voices and their 
projects autonomously and authentically, marginalized by the social exclusion already mentioned.
